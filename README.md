# learning-by-example-gen-ai
A personal learning project for GenAI, Chatbots, AI Agents, etc.


## Modules
This project is implemented in modules, each one building on the one before it. The current planned modules are below:

- M1 - Chat interface - A basic chatgpt-style clone, capable of general conversation and text-based questions and answers.
- M2 - Custom prompts - Adds a series of pre-built prompts to the chat interface, to allow the user to cater the output to the task at hand. A study on prompt writing
- M3 - Docs as Context - Adds the ability to upload documents in common formats (docx, pdf, etc.), and use those as context for the conversation. A study on document pre-processing.
- M4 - Vector DB - Use an llm for embeddings, not text responses. Then turn a set of documents into a search index using those embeddings.
